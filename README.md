Snackbar
========

This is not the normal SnackBar which is coming up in Android L.

I started by forking a repo but soon changed almost all of it to create a new view. I am still calling this a Snackbar as it comes at the bottom of the screen, but the layout is like the notification in Android L. This repo is still in pre-Alpha stage and I would soon add some screenshots.
